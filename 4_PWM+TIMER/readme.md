*This STM32 main.c generated from CubeMX.* 

In this project I am going to show PWM with Advanced TIMER 1 (Hardware Timer) and changing the Frequency and Duty cycle of the PWM signal with the help of ADC1. If you are interested in only running the PWM of TIM1 without ADC on a fixed Duty cycle and frequency then omit the part of ADC initilazation.  

Do the follwing setting in CubeMX to get started:  
  
**Common Steps to followed in every project:** 

1. *New Project* &#x2192; *Start My Project from MCU* &#x2192; *Access to MCU selector*.
2. Select the board **STM32F407VG** to initialze the project.
3. Go to *System Core* &#x2192; *RCC* &#x2192; *High Speed Clock (HSE)* &#x2192; *Crsytal/Ceramic Resonator*
4. Switch to *Clock Configuration* tab.
    * Set *Input frequency* to 8 Mhz
    * Select *HSE* and *PLLCLK* and write 168Mhz in *HCLK*
5. Switch to *Project Manager* tab 
    * Select **MDK-ARM** from *Code Generator* &#x2192; *ToolChain IDE.*
    * Choose your folder and click on **Generate Code**

**Specific steps:**   
Configure the pinouts according to your requirement:   
1.  **For this code configure PA1 as ADC1_IN1.**
2.  Go to *Timers* &#x2192; TIM1 &#x2192; Channel1 -- PWM Generation CH1.
3.  In the **NVIC settings** *Enable: TIM1 update interrupt and TIM10 global interrupt.*  
4.  In the **Parameter settings** *Prescaler: 1680-1*, *Counter Period: 100-1.*
5.  Attach a POT to vary the input to ADC1 of STM32 board.
